# Hierarchical-Optimal-Transport
This repository is based on the source code of "Hierarchical Optimal Transport for Document Representation" by Mikhail Yurochkin and al.

It is a project report for this research paper done for the Computational Optimal Transport course from the MVA master, supervised by Gabriel Peyr√©.

I made comparison ofthe HOTT metric against other hierarchical metrics such as L1-OT, KL-OT, MMD-OT, evaluating them on a straighforward document classfication task with K-Nearest-Neighbors.
